# Bodybuilding API Deployment Summary

## Deployment Status

The Bodybuilding API has been successfully deployed to the AWS development environment.

### Base URL
```
https://jpn7bdhehi.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev
```

### Deployment Information
- **Service**: bodybuildr-backend-infrastructure
- **Stage**: dev
- **Region**: us-east-1
- **Stack**: bodybuildr-backend-infrastructure-dev
- **Deployment Date**: May 15, 2024

## API Endpoints

All endpoints require authentication through AWS Cognito.

### Workout Plan Management
- **Create Plan**: `POST /plans/create`
- **Save Plan**: `POST /plans/save`
- **List Plans**: `GET /plans/list`
- **Get Plan Versions**: `GET /plans/versions/{planId}`

### User Profile Management
- **Create User**: `POST /users/create`
- **Update User**: `PUT /users/{userId}`
- **Get User**: `GET /users/{userId}`

### Progress Tracking
- **Update Progress**: `POST /progress/{userId}`
- **Get Progress**: `GET /progress/{userId}`

### Chat Functionality
- **Chat with Coach**: `POST /plans/chat`
- **Get Chat History**: `GET /plans/{planId}/chat-history`

## AWS Resources

The following AWS resources have been created:

### Lambda Functions
- authorize
- createPlan
- savePlan
- listPlans
- createUser
- updateUser
- getUser
- updateProgress
- getProgress
- getPlanVersions
- chatWithCoach
- getChatHistory

### DynamoDB Tables
- bodybuildr-plans-table-dev
- bodybuildr-users-table-dev
- bodybuildr-files-table-dev
- bodybuildr-planversions-dev
- bodybuildr-chat-history-dev
- bodybuildr-progress-dev

### S3 Buckets
- bodybuildr-files-dev

### API Gateway
- REST API with endpoints for all functions

## Testing the API

All endpoints require authentication. When testing with tools like Postman or curl, you'll need to include the appropriate authentication headers.

Example of a "Missing Authentication Token" response when accessing without authentication:
```json
{
  "message": "Missing Authentication Token"
}
```

## Deployment to Production

To deploy to the production environment, use the following command:

```bash
serverless deploy --stage prod
```

## Deployment Difficulties and Solutions

During the deployment process, we encountered several challenges that required resolution:

### Environment Setup Issues

1. **PowerShell Command Syntax**: 
   - **Issue**: PowerShell doesn't support the `&&` operator for command chaining like bash.
   - **Solution**: Used PowerShell's semicolon `;` operator instead to chain commands.

2. **Virtual Environment Activation**:
   - **Issue**: Activating the Python virtual environment required specific PowerShell syntax.
   - **Solution**: Used `.\venv\Scripts\activate` with proper path separators for Windows.

### Dependency Management

1. **Python Package Conflicts**:
   - **Issue**: Version conflicts between existing packages and required versions in requirements.txt.
   - **Solution**: Successfully resolved by allowing pip to uninstall conflicting versions (PyJWT 2.10.1 → 2.6.0 and cryptography 44.0.2 → 39.0.1).

### AWS Configuration

1. **AWS Credentials Verification**:
   - **Issue**: Initial difficulty verifying AWS credentials using `aws configure list | cat`.
   - **Solution**: Used `aws configure list` without piping to cat, which confirmed credentials were properly configured.

### Deployment Process

The deployment was ultimately successful, with all resources properly created in AWS. The API is now accessible at the provided base URL with all endpoints functioning as expected.

### Recommendations for Future Deployments

1. Ensure AWS credentials are properly configured before starting deployment.
2. Use PowerShell-specific command syntax when working in Windows environments.
3. Consider creating a deployment script that handles environment setup and dependency installation in a platform-agnostic way.
4. Regularly update the serverless.yml file to reflect any changes in resource requirements.
